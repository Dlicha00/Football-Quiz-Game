Project Title: Premier League Quiz Game in C
Name: Leul Ejigu 
Major: Computer Science

The Premier League Quiz Game is a program inspired by a nostalgic game played during high school with friends. By combining the joy of football trivia with programming, this project brings together two personal passions. The game challenges users to guess the names of players based on their jersey numbers, enhancing their knowledge of the Premier League while enjoying an interactive quiz. Developed in C, the project employs structures, randomization, and user input to create a simple yet engaging experience.

Back in high school, my friends and I would often quiz each other on Premier League players, testing how well we knew our favorite teams and stars. This project is my way of bringing those fun memories to life through programming. By combining two things I love, football and coding, I aimed to recreate this game in a digital format that others can share and enjoy.
The rules are simple: choose a Premier League team, and the program will prompt you to guess players based on their jersey numbers. With three attempts per question, the game challenges your football knowledge while keeping the experience light-hearted and entertaining.
In this project, I utilized structures (struct) to store team and player data, ensuring a well-organized codebase. I implemented random number generation to add unpredictability by selecting random players for each question, a concept I researched extensively and explored through various YouTube videos to gain a solid understanding. String manipulation played a vital role in allowing accurate comparison of user input with stored player names. Additionally, I incorporated custom gameplay, enabling users to select their favorite team in the Premier League, which personalized the overall experience.
I faced several challenges while developing the program. First, I needed to ensure that it accurately accepted full player names, including spaces, which involved experimenting with input functions like ‘scanf’ and understanding format specifiers. Additionally, to keep the game experience fresh, I had to properly seed the random number generator using ‘time.h’, which took time to learn and apply effectively in the code. Structuring the quiz logic was another challenge, as I had to consider every possible outcome, including correct guesses, failed attempts, and edge cases; this required careful planning and extensive debugging. Lastly, I dedicated a significant amount of time to customizing the program by entering each player's details for every tournament.
 
To enhance the game experience, several suggestions for future improvements could be considered. Expanding the team database to include all leagues, such as Bundesliga and Serie A, along with their complete rosters, would make the game more comprehensive. Introducing a multiplayer mode could add a competitive element, allowing friends to play against one another and recreating the high school experience. Additionally, features for score tracking and display would boost engagement, while creating a graphical user interface (GUI) would provide a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.


Conclusion
Developing the Premier League Quiz Game was a fulfilling experience that combined two of my favorite things: football and coding. It allowed me to revisit a fun high school memory while strengthening my programming skills. The project demonstrates how C programming can be used to build simple yet enjoyable applications. While there’s room for improvement, the current version of the game provides an engaging way to test football knowledge and have fun.
